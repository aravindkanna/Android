Intern At Omitra


This code is just a skeletal implementation of the work I had done for Omitra App. It finds the signal strength at a particual place, in background. You can start and stop the tracing of the data using a start and stop buttons provided. The found data can stored into the mobile's default data(implemented using mysql). The data can be deleted accordingly.
